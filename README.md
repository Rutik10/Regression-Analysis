# Regression-Analysis
Regression Analysis On California Housing

The goal of this Project is to understand the logic, methods, and types available to implement
machine learning Regression Analysis.
Machine Learning Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent
variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It’s used as a method for predictive modelling
in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.
In this project, we’ll deal with specific type of data input, real-estate, housing data. Specifically, we’ll try to
build a predictive house pricing strategy for future house-for-sale purchases based on historical values! 

Perform distinct simple predictive strategies in Python which will be based on Machine Learning
Regression modeling approaches.
The following steps, generating the ML Regressors, are performed performed:
 Pre-process and clean the data.
 Define the Feature Variable ‘X’, and the Label/Target variable ‘y’.
 Spilt the data into training and test datasets (use the 8020 percent ratio.)
 Choose a Linear Regressor Model and fit it on the training dataset (take its default parameters)
 Evaluate the Regressor on the test dataset.


Utilize the following ML Linear Regressor Models:
1_ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

2_ LASSO Regressor (L1)

3_ Ridge Regressor (L2)

4_ Elastic Regressor (L1 & L2)
